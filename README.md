Jison (remastered)
==================

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@lahmatiy/jison.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lahmatiy/jison)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lahmatiy/jison.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lahmatiy/jison)

That's a fork of [Jison](http://github.com/zaach/jison) parser generator by [Zach Carter](http://github.com/zaach/).

The difference:

- Removed web site sources
- Removed CLI & bundling. Those things may back in the future but in fresh way
- Removed generator methods except `generateModule`
- Refactored to use ES6+ features, remove redundant abstractions, minor bug fixes
- Features:
    - Added support for function patterns in lexer

An API for creating parsers in JavaScript
-----------------------------------------

Jison generates bottom-up parsers in JavaScript. Its API is similar to Bison's, hence the name. It supports many of Bison's major features, plus some of its own. If you are new to parser generators such as Bison, and Context-free Grammars in general, a [good introduction][1] is found in the Bison manual. If you already know Bison, Jison should be easy to pickup.

Briefly, Jison takes a JSON encoded grammar or Bison style grammar and outputs a JavaScript file capable of parsing the language described by that grammar. You can then use the generated script to parse inputs and accept, reject, or perform actions based on the input.

## Installation

```
    npm install @lahmatiy/jison
```

## Usage

```javascript
// mygenerator.js
const { Parser } = require('jison');

// a grammar in JSON
const grammar = {
    lex: {
        rules: [
           ['\\s+', '/* skip whitespace */'],
           ['[a-f0-9]+', 'return "HEX";']
        ]
    },

    bnf: {
        hex_strings: [
            'hex_strings HEX', 'HEX'
        ]
    }
};

// `grammar` can also be a string that uses jison's grammar format
const parser = new Parser(grammar);

// now you can use the parser directly from memory
// returns true
parser.parse("adfe34bc e82a");

// throws lexical error
parser.parse("adfe34bc zxg");

// ... or generate source code of parser
const parserSource = parser.generateModule();
```
